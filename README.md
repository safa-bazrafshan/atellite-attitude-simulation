# Satellite Attitude Dynamics Simulation

This project simulates the single-axis rotational dynamics of a satellite under various torque inputs using MATLAB.

## Project Overview

We modeled the satellite's rotational motion using Euler's equations for a rigid body, assuming a single rotational axis. The simulation explores three cases:

1. Constant Torque
2. Random Disturbance Torque (Noise)
3. Sinusoidal Control Torque

Each case shows the resulting:
- Angular Position (θ)
- Angular Velocity (ω)
- Applied Torque (τ)
